# Next.js 15 App Router Bug: Dynamic Route Navigation Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when navigating between pages utilizing dynamic routes.  The application functions correctly on the initial load but exhibits unexpected behavior (incorrect rendering or 404 errors) upon subsequent navigation.

## Bug Description

The issue manifests when navigating between pages with dynamic routes.  While the initial navigation works as expected, any subsequent navigation attempt using client-side transitions can lead to incorrect page content or 404 errors.  This problem occurs despite the dynamic routes being correctly defined.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate between different dynamic routes in the application.  You should observe the unexpected behavior after the first navigation.

## Potential Causes

Possible explanations include issues with the App Router's routing logic, data fetching mechanisms, or caching strategies under specific navigation patterns in the dynamic routing context.  Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause.

## Expected Behavior

Seamless navigation between different dynamic routes without any rendering or navigation errors.

## Actual Behavior

Incorrect rendering of page content or 404 errors upon subsequent navigation attempts.

## Solution (In bugSolution.js)

The bug might be due to issues with how the router handles client-side transitions, especially when combined with dynamic segments in the routes. The solution might involve ensuring the router correctly handles the revalidation of data or the route parameters after each navigation event. Further investigation is needed to determine the specific cause and the appropriate solution.  A potential approach could involve utilizing `useSearchParams` or other relevant hooks to explicitly manage parameters during navigation.
